## How to Use This Guide üìù

1.  **Understand the Pattern:** Start with the **Core Idea** to grasp the fundamental recurrence relation and state definition.
2.  **Solve the Problems:** Work through the **Practice Problems**, starting with the easier ones to build confidence.
3.  **Master the Approach:** For every problem, practice formulating the recursive solution first, then applying memoization, and finally converting it to a bottom-up tabulation approach.
